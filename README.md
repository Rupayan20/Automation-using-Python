# Automation-using-Python
Here we search for something in the search option in Google Chrome and from there a video suggestion is opened and moved to YouTube.  After that, we have to set what you want to search automatically in the search option on YouTube.  Again it will automatically appear in the search bar and the new video suggestion will appear in the search engine.
